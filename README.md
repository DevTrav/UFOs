# UFO Sightings

![ufo](static/images/ufo_image.jpeg)

Data visualization of UFO sighting data using: `JS`, `D3`, `Bootstrap`, `HTML`, and `CSS`.

## Purpose

Build a filterable, dynamic table with data that is stored as a JavaScript array or list and filters information for users. In order to filter when an element is changed, we use Javascript functions to loop through the data to build the table and create a customized dashboard.

## Results

The [UFO Sightings webpage](https://devtrav.github.io/UFOs/) was deployed and accessible

- We are able to filter by the following criteria: `State`, `country`, `city`, `date` and UFO `shape`.

# Summary

- The UI could use a button for users to clear search results and return the table to the default state.
- A results download option could also be useful for those using the data elsewhere
