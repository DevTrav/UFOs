# UFO Sightings

![ufo](static/images/ufo_image.jpeg)

Data visualization of UFO sighting data using: `JS`, `D3 library`, `Bootstrap`, `HTML`, and `CSS`.

## Purpose

Build a filterable, dynamic table with data that is stored as a JavaScript array or list and filters information for users. In order to filter when an element is changed, we use Javascript functions to loop through the data to build the table and create a customized dashboard.
